* The [Grid experiments notebook](./grid_experiments.ipynb) includes code to evaluate agents on grid tasks inspired by [Russek et al., 2017](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005768).

* The graph experiments notebooks [(Experiment 1)](./graph_experiments_1.ipynb) [(Experiment 2)](./graph_experiments_2.ipynb) includes code to evaluate agents on graph tasks taken from [Momennejad et al., 2017](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-017-0180-8).
