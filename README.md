# Learning Dynamics in Anxiety: The Role of Punishment Sensitivity and Learning Rate in Sequential Evaluation

Neuro-Nav (Juliani, A. et. al, 2022), an open-source library for neurally plausible reinforcement learning (RL), was used to perform the simulations and program the RL models developed in the thesis project.  

The main modifications added to the neronav library are the following: 

- TDSR - finisehd to implement the B-pessimisitc module to the succesors function.
- TDSR_RP - added different learning rate for rewards and punishments to the TDSR model, which we call as a-SR.
- DynaSR_B - refeering to the Dyna B-pessimistic SR model implementation.
- DynaSR_RP - refeering to the Dyna a-SR model implementation.

See [agents](./agents) for more information.

Most of the code from the library that wasnâ€™t used for the project was erased as well.

## Poster presented at MAIN 2024 (Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience)

"The Impact of Punishment Sensitivity and Learning Rate on Anxiety: A Computational Modeling Approach in a Sequential Evaluation Task". This work won the Best Undergraduate Poster Award.

Currently a scientific paper is in preparation, but you can see the [poster](.Poster_MAIN_2024.pdf) and [abstract](https://www.main2024.org/abstracts) of the work presented at MAIN.

## Experiment's Notebook

A Google Colab Notebook includes the simulations made for the thesis project. It has text with brief explanations in spanish and english as well.

See [Notebook.ipynb](./Notebook.ipynb) for more information.


## Requirements
