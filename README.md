# Thesis project: The computational study of anxiety using AI algorithms

Neuro-Nav (Juliani, A. et. al, 2022), an open-source library for neurally plausible reinforcement learning (RL), was used to perform the simulations and program the RL models developed in the thesis project.  

The main modifications added to the neronav library are the following two models implementations: 

- DynaSR_B - refeering to the Dyna B-pessimistic SR model implementation.
- DynaSR_RP - refeering to the Dyna a-SR model implementation.

See [agents](./agents) for more information.


## Poster presented at MAIN 2024

"The Impact of Punishment Sensitivity and Learning Rate on Anxiety: A Computational Modeling Approach in a Sequential Evaluation Task".

## Experiment Notebook

A Google Colab Notebook includes the simulations made for the thesis project. 

See [notebook](./notebook) for more information.


## Requirements

Requirements for the `neuronav` library can be found [here](./setup.py).

## Contributing

Neuro-Nav is an open source project.
