# Thesis project 
## The computational study of anxiety using AI algorithms

Neuro-Nav (Juliani, A. et. al, 2022), an open-source library for neurally plausible reinforcement learning (RL), was used to perform the simulations and program the RL models developed in the thesis project.  

The main modifications added to the neronav library are the following two models implementations: 

- DynaSR_B - refeering to the Dyna B-pessimistic SR model implementation.
- DynaSR_RP - refeering to the Dyna a-SR model implementation.

See [agents](./agents) for more information.


## Poster presented at MAIN 2024 (Montreal Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience)

"The Impact of Punishment Sensitivity and Learning Rate on Anxiety: A Computational Modeling Approach in a Sequential Evaluation Task".

See abstract [here](https://www.main2024.org/abstracts). This work gained the Best Undergraduate Poster Award. 

## Experiment Notebook

A Google Colab Notebook includes the simulations made for the thesis project. 

See [Notebook.ipynb](./Notebook.ipynb) for more information.


## Requirements
